// 45.	Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, options: Record<string, any>): Record<string, any> {
    return { manufacturer, model, ...options };
}

const carInfo = createCar("Toyota", "Camry", { color: "Blue", year: 2023, features: ["Navigation", "Sunroof"] });

console.log("Car Information:");
console.log(carInfo);
